Data comes from https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/JRZDDR

We generated the following images using the matlab script process_file.m which borrows from some functions provided with the data as well as follows the general procedure to process the data

Here are our old images

![Image1](Images/100.png)

![Image2](Images/10.png)

This was done by running the following commands: 


clear
read_Intan_RHD2000_file
scaled_shiftd = ((amplifier_data / 10) + 0.5)*300;
image(scaled_shiftd(:,300:400),'CDataMapping','direct')
scaled_shiftd = ((amplifier_data / 100) + 0.5)*300;
image(scaled_shiftd(:,300:400),'CDataMapping','direct')

New Images

![Image3](Images/rat6_dorsiflection_2_200.png)

Generated by running the script and then selecting which data file to use and what spike to generate an image for.
